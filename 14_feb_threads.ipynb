    "# Q1: What is multithreading in Python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multithreading is a technique in programming where multiple threads run concurrently within a single process.\n",
    "# It allows for parallel execution of tasks, which can lead to more efficient use of CPU resources and faster program execution.\n",
    "# It is often used to perform tasks that are I/O bound or require waiting, allowing other tasks to proceed concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The module used to handle threads in Python is `threading`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2: Why threading module used? Write the use of the following functions\n",
    "# - activeCount()\n",
    "# - currentThread()\n",
    "# - enumerate()\n",
    "\n",
    "# The `threading` module provides a way to create and manage threads in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - `activeCount()`: Returns the number of Thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "# - `currentThread()`: Returns the current Thread object, corresponding to the caller's thread of control.\n",
    "# - `enumerate()`: Returns a list of all Thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",

    "# - run()\n",
    "# - start()\n",
    "# - join()\n",
    "# - isAlive()\n",
    "\n",
    "# - `run()`: Method that represents the code to be executed by a thread. It should be overridden in a subclass of Thread.\n",
    "# - `start()`: Starts the thread's activity by calling the `run()` method in a new thread of control.\n",
    "# - `join()`: Blocks the calling thread until the thread whose `join()` method is called terminates.\n",
    "# - `isAlive()`: Returns whether the thread is alive (i.e., has been started and has not yet terminated).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4: Write a Python program to create two threads. Thread one must print the list of squares and thread two must print the list of cubes.\n",

    "# Advantages:\n",
    "# 1. Improved performance on multi-core processors.\n",
    "# 2. Better resource utilization and responsiveness in I/O bound programs.\n",
    "# 3. Simpler program structure for tasks that are naturally concurrent.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Disadvantages:\n",
    "# 1. Increased complexity in program design and debugging.\n",
    "# 2. Potential for race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "# 3. Threads share memory space, which can lead to synchronization issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6: Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Deadlocks:\n",
    "# A deadlock is a situation in which two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a resource.\n",
    "# Example: Two threads may hold locks on two resources and each thread is waiting for the resource held by the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Race Conditions:\n",
    "# A race condition occurs when two or more threads access shared resources concurrently and the outcome depends on the order of execution.\n",
    "# Example: Two threads updating the same variable without proper synchronization can lead to inconsistent or incorrect results.\n"
