    "# Q1: What is multiprocessing in Python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiprocessing in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple processes, each running in its own Python interpreter.\n",
    "# It is useful for parallelizing CPU-bound tasks, as it allows multiple processes to run simultaneously on different CPU cores.\n",
    "# This can significantly improve performance for tasks that require a lot of computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2: What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Multiprocessing:\n",
    "#   - Involves creating multiple processes, each with its own memory space.\n",
    "#   - Suitable for CPU-bound tasks as it bypasses Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n",
    "#   - Each process runs independently, which can improve performance for heavy computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Multithreading:\n",
    "#   - Involves creating multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space.\n",
    "#   - Suitable for I/O-bound tasks where threads can run concurrently while waiting for I/O operations.\n",
    "#   - Limited by Python's GIL, which can prevent multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes in parallel.\n",
