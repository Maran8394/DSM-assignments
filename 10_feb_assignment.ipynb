    "# **Function to Open a File:**\n",
    "# The `open()` function is used to open a file in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Different Modes of Opening a File:**\n",
    "\n",
    "# - `'r'`: Read mode (default). Opens the file for reading. If the file does not exist, an error is raised.\n",
    "# - `'w'`: Write mode. Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, its content is truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "# - `'a'`: Append mode. Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, data is appended to the end. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "# - `'b'`: Binary mode. This can be appended to other modes (e.g., `'rb'` or `'wb'`) to handle binary files.\n",
    "# - `'x'`: Exclusive creation. If the file already exists, the operation fails.\n",
    "# - `'t'`: Text mode (default). This can be appended to other modes (e.g., `'rt'` or `'wt'`) for handling text files.\n",
