    "# Q1: What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "# A database is a structured collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It typically uses a database management system (DBMS) to handle the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL Databases (Relational Databases):\n",
    "# - Structured Query Language (SQL) is used for querying and managing the data.\n",
    "# - Data is organized in tables with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are defined using keys.\n",
    "# - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "# NoSQL Databases (Non-relational Databases):\n",
    "# - Not primarily based on SQL and typically handle unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "# - Data can be stored in various formats such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or columns.\n",
    "# - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2: What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "# DDL (Data Definition Language) is used to define and manage database schema and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - CREATE: Used to create new database objects like tables, indexes, or databases.\n",
    "#   Example: `CREATE TABLE students (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100));`\n",
    "\n",
    "# - DROP: Used to delete database objects such as tables, indexes, or databases.\n",
    "#   Example: `DROP TABLE students;`\n",
    "\n",
    "# - ALTER: Used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or dropping columns.\n",
    "#   Example: `ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN age INT;`\n",
    "\n",
    "# - TRUNCATE: Used to remove all records from a table but keeps the table structure intact.\n",
    "#   Example: `TRUNCATE TABLE students;`\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3: What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "# DML (Data Manipulation Language) is used to manage and manipulate data within database objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - INSERT: Adds new records to a table.\n",
    "#   Example: `INSERT INTO students (id, name) VALUES (1, 'John Doe');`\n",
    "\n",
    "# - UPDATE: Modifies existing records in a table.\n",
    "#   Example: `UPDATE students SET name = 'Jane Doe' WHERE id = 1;`\n",
    "\n",
    "# - DELETE: Removes records from a table.\n",
    "#   Example: `DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 1;`\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4: What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "# DQL (Data Query Language) is used to query and retrieve data from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.\n",
    "#   Example: `SELECT * FROM students;`  # Retrieves all columns and rows from the students table.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5: Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Primary Key: A unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each record is uniquely identifiable.\n",
    "#   Example: In a table `students`, the column `id` can be the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Foreign Key: A column (or set of columns) in one table that refers to the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between the tables.\n",
    "#   Example: In a `grades` table, `student_id` might be a foreign key that references `id` in the `students` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6: Write a Python code to connect MySQL to Python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establishing a connection to the MySQL database\n",
    "conn = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    host=\"localhost\",\n",
    "    user=\"your_username\",\n",
    "    password=\"your_password\",\n",
    "    database=\"your_database\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a cursor object using cursor() method\n",
    "cursor = conn.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of using execute() method to run a query\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM students\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetching the results\n",
    "results = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "for row in results:\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Closing the cursor and connection\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "conn.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7: Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The typical order of execution for SQL clauses in a query is:\n",
    "# 1. `FROM`: Specifies the tables from which to retrieve data.\n",
    "# 2. `JOIN`: Combines rows from multiple tables based on a related column.\n",
    "# 3. `WHERE`: Filters rows based on a condition.\n",
    "# 4. `GROUP BY`: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.\n",
    "# 5. `HAVING`: Filters groups based on a condition.\n",
    "# 6. `SELECT`: Specifies the columns to be returned.\n",
    "# 7. `ORDER BY`: Sorts the result set based on one or more columns.\n",
    "# 8. `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`: Limits the number of rows returned or skips a number of rows.\n"
