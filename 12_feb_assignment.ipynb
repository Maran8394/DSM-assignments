    "#   - Occur during the execution of the program.\n",

    "#   - Occur when there is a mistake in the syntax of the code.\n",
    "#   - Detected by the Python interpreter before the program runs.\n",
    "#   - Examples include missing colons, mismatched parentheses, or incorrect indentation.\n",
