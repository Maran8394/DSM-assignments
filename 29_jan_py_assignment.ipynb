    "# 1. Who developed Python Programming Language?\n",
    "# Answer: Python was developed by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Which type of Programming does Python support?\n",
    "# Answer: Python supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "# Answer: Yes, Python is case sensitive. For example, `Variable` and `variable` would be considered different identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. What is the correct extension of the Python file?\n",
    "# Answer: The correct extension for a Python file is `.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "# Answer: Python code is interpreted. Python code is executed line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?\n",
    "# Answer: Some blocks of code used in Python include:\n",
    "# - Functions (`def function_name():`)\n",
    "# - Classes (`class ClassName:`)\n",
    "# - Loops (`for` and `while` loops)\n",
    "# - Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python?\n",
    "# Answer: The hash symbol `#` is used for single-line comments in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "# Answer: The `sys.version` and `platform.python_version()` functions can be used to find the Python version.\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "import platform\n",
    "print(sys.version)\n",
    "print(platform.python_version())\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called\n",
    "# Answer: Python supports the creation of anonymous functions using a construct called `lambda`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. What does pip stand for python?\n",
    "# Answer: `pip` stands for \"Pip Installs Packages.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 11. Mention a few built-in functions in python?\n",
    "# Answer: Some built-in functions in Python include `print()`, `len()`, `type()`, `max()`, and `min()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?\n",
    "# Answer: The maximum length of an identifier in Python is not explicitly limited by the language itself, but practically, it can be very long (e.g., thousands of characters), depending on the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 13. What are the benefits of using Python?\n",
    "# Answer: Benefits of using Python include its simplicity and readability, extensive standard library, strong community support, and versatility in application (web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 14. How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "# Answer: Memory in Python is managed by the Python memory manager which includes built-in garbage collection and reference counting to automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?\n",
    "# Answer: To install Python on Windows:\n",
    "# 1. Download the Python installer from the official website (https://www.python.org/).\n",
    "# 2. Run the installer and make sure to check the box that says \"Add Python to PATH.\"\n",
    "# 3. Follow the installation prompts.\n",
    "# To set path variables manually:\n",
    "# 1. Go to System Properties > Environment Variables.\n",
    "# 2. Under System variables, find the PATH variable and add the path to the Python executable (e.g., `C:\\Python39\\`).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 16. Is indentation required in Python?\n",
    "# Answer: Yes, indentation is required in Python. It is used to define the structure of code blocks, such as in loops, conditionals, and function definitions.\n"
